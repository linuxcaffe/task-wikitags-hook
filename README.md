# tw-wikitags-hook
_on-add or on-mod, :tag1:tag2: format, in task description, generates +tag1 +tag2_

Vimwiki/ taskwiki/ *ledger/ orgmode and several other projects, use a tag format that :looks: :like:this: 

The advantages are that tags can be created while writing the description and that this type of tag can be used for several different things by several applications. There's also valuable information seeing :tags:like: :this: in description text and knowing that taskwarrior +tags +like +this exist, even if they're not displayed. 

(install notes can be found in the script comments.)
